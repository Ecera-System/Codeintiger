Contributing to the CodeIgniter Skeleton Project
===============
You are welcome to submit a contribution for review and possible inclusion in the project but, before it will be accepted, we ask that you follow these simple steps:

1. Open an issue on project's Github [Issues](https://github.com/bkader/skeleton/issues) section. If you can, please provide a fix and create a pull request instead; this will automatically create an issue for you so you do not have to create an issue if you are creating a pull request.

2. We do our best to follow CodeIgniter's [PHP Style Guide](https://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/styleguide.html), so make sure to read all on the provided link if you haven't already.

3. When filing an issue or opening a pull request, please include a clear title and description. The title should be a short summary of an issue and, if possible, should include a reference to an open issue. For example `Invalid Argument in add_meta (Ref #1234)` would be sufficient. All issues and pull requests should include a description with as mush details as possible.  
In case of a pull request, include what the issue is, what the request is about, testing instructions and your environment information (PHP Version, database driver and version, and other data you can retrieve from your site's system information view) in case the issue is specific to certain environments. If additional information is needed, please be prepared to provide it as our contributors review your submission.

4. Anything that cannot be put as an issue or a pull request can simply be emailed to us if you want: <skeleton@ianhub.net> or <codeigniter.skeleton@gmail.com>.

Please be patient as not all items will be tested immediately (remember, all bug testing for CodeIgniter Skeleton is done by the project maintainer or by kind volunteers) and be receptive to feedback about your code.

#### Branches
Pull requests should usually be made to the `develop` branch as this contains the most recent version of the code.  
There are other branches available which serve specific purposes.

| Branch | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| develop | All work is done on this branch. Once a new and stable release is ready, all changes will be passed to `master` branch and a tag is created. |
| master | That's actually the main branch that should be at the same level as the `develop` branch. This is the stable branch that you may use on production environment. |
