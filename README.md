[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/CodeIgniterSkeleton/skeleton](https://badges.gitter.im/CodeIgniterSkeleton/skeleton.svg)](https://gitter.im/CodeIgniterSkeleton/skeleton?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A CodeIgniter starter kit with lots of add-ons to give you a head start when developing web application.

## What Does Contain?
The most important thing added to CodeIgniter is the plugins features, with filters and actions just like WordPress. But here is a list of main features:  

* Application-free themes that can handle their own assets and have independent actions on the application. No need to handle themes on Controllers except for `rendering` views, settings pages titles and data to pass to views.
* Plugins system where you can install, upload, activate, deactivate and delete plugins, just like WordPress, Joomla! and others.
* Modules management where you can as well install, activate, deactivate and delete modules.
* Themes management system.
* Users management.
* An application-free and ready-to-use dashboard.
* Multiple application contexts: `ajax`, `process`, `content`, `help`, `reports` and `settings`.
* Themes-free authentication and registration as well as independent dashboard login page.
* Multilingual support.

## Why a ready-to-use database
Our database contains **9** required tables and a single optional table (`sessions`). With only these table you can create any type of web application. See [Development Logic](https://github.com/bkader/skeleton/wiki/Development-Logics) on project [Wiki](https://github.com/bkader/skeleton/wiki).
